## Prepare the train data 
The aim of this project is to obtain high-quality training data by downloading and processing images from the ILSVRC-2012 dataset and using a pre-trained Imagenet model for high-confidence filtering of the images. The following are the specific steps to accomplish this task using Python and PyTorch:
- Download the ILSVRC-2012 Dataset：Before starting, make sure you have downloaded the ILSVRC-2012 dataset, which contains 1.2 million images. You can obtain the dataset from a suitable source and save it in your local environment.
- Import Necessary Libraries：In your Python code, first import the required libraries, including PyTorch and torchvision.models. These libraries will be used to load the pre-trained Imagenet model and perform image preprocessing.
```
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
```
- Create and Load the Pre-trained Model：In this example, we choose to use ResNet-50 as the pre-trained model. You can choose other models according to your needs. The following code loads the ResNet-50 model and loads the pre-trained weights:
```
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
```
- Image Preprocessing：Before feeding the images into the model, they need to be preprocessed. This includes resizing the images to a specified size, performing center cropping, converting them to tensor format, and normalizing them. The following code snippet demonstrates how to preprocess the images using torchvision.transforms:
```
preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```
- Set the Model to Evaluation Mode：
```
model.eval()
```
- Dataset Filtering and Selection:Next, we will perform inference on the entire dataset using the pre-trained model and select images with high-confidence predictions. To ensure dataset diversity, we will uniformly select a certain number of samples from each category in Imagenet. Specifically, we will sort each category based on the highest confidence output by the pre-trained model and select the top k samples with the highest confidence. The value of k is calculated as 122,186 (the number of categories in the ILSVRC-2012 dataset) divided by the number of categories in the Imagenet dataset being used.
- Code File Structure:After completing dataset filtering and selection, you can organize the relevant code into a single file for easy replacement of the dataset path and project execution. Our approach is to store the dataset categorized in different folders and in .jpg format.
